## Usage
Here's a basic example of how to use the Design System UI components in your React application:
```
jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Button, Card, Input } from 'design-system-ui';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Card>
        <Input placeholder="Enter text" />
        <Button>Click me</Button>
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

The library provides a variety of pre-designed components that follow the guidelines of your design tokens.

## Design Tokens

Design tokens are a key part of the Design System UI. These tokens define the core design elements of your application, such as colors, typography, spacing, and more. By maintaining a single source of truth for design, you can ensure consistency across your project. The library allows you to easily access and apply these design tokens to your components.

To define and customize your design tokens, check the design-tokens.js file in your project. You can adapt these tokens to your specific design system requirements.

## Customization

The Design System UI is designed to be flexible and customizable to fit your unique design system. You can override default styles, modify design tokens, and create custom components that inherit the library's styling.

To customize the library, please refer to the customization guide for more details.
